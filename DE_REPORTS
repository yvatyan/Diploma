========================= How to Use =========================
Legend:
DR - Defect report      - Use to submit bugs that you find
ER - Enhancement report - Use to submit new features to add

Status of ER\DR:
[<S>ubmitted: user.name]  - user.name submitted this ER\DR
[<A>ssigned : user.name]  - user.name will work on it
[<O>pened   : user.name]  - user.name is currently working on it
[<R>esolved : user.name]  - user.name fixed this ER\DR
[<D>enied   : user.name]  - user.name denied ER\DR as it can't be done, it was unnecessary or etc.

Format:
(<status_letter>:<user.name>) [DR|ER]<number>:<title>
                              /***DESCRIPTION:
                              <description>
                              /***RESOLUTION:
                              <resolved description>
Example:
(R: Yuri    ) ER0000: "How to Use" example
              /***DESCRIPTION:
              This is example of how to format DR\ER on submit and handle.
              /***RESOLUTION:
              Here should be described what else was done while resolving report.

Notes:
1. Next submitted report either DR or ER should have previous number incremented, no matter what type it had
2. User.name closing bracket should be under each other
3. Write DESCRIPTION if there is too much to describe in title (e.g. how to reproduce bug)
4. Description\Resolution should be alighned under ER\DR number
5. Resoltion appears when additional changes where done (e.g. name of label which wasn't related to report was changed)
